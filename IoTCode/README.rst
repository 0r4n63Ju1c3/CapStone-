This code is tailored specifically for testing the IoT infrastructure. 

These two files are the main files to test IoT:

1. cybercity_weather.py   -> fake weather stations 
2. weatherListener.py     -> See Data MQTT server is receiving 

Supporting infrastructure to ensure above two files work:

1. encryption.py
2. iotComm.py
3. mqtt_protocol.py
